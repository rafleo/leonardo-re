			<h4>Types of Data collected</h4>

			<p>
				Among the types of Personal Data that this Website collects, by itself or through third
				parties, there are Cookies.
			</p>
			<p>
				Complete details on each type of Personal Data collected are provided in the dedicated
				sections of this privacy policy or by specific explanation texts displayed prior to the Data
				collection.<br />Personal Data may be freely provided by the User, or, in case of Usage
				Data, collected automatically when using this Website.<br />Unless specified otherwise, all
				Data requested by this Website is mandatory and failure to provide this Data may make it
				impossible for this Website to provide its services. In cases where this Website
				specifically states that some Data is not mandatory, Users are free not to communicate this
				Data without consequences to the availability or the functioning of the Service.<br />Users
				who are uncertain about which Personal Data is mandatory are welcome to contact the Owner.<br
				/>Any use of Cookies – or of other tracking tools – by this Website or by the owners of
				third-party services used by this Website serves the purpose of providing the Service
				required by the User, in addition to any other purposes described in the present document
				and in the Cookie Policy, if available.
			</p>
			<p>
				Users are responsible for any third-party Personal Data obtained, published or shared
				through this Website and confirm that they have the third party's consent to provide the
				Data to the Owner.
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="container">

			<h4>Mode and place of processing the Data</h4>

			<h5>Methods of processing</h5>
			<p>
				The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure,
				modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Data.<br />The Data processing is carried
				out using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes
				strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the
				Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of
				this Website (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external
				parties (such as third-party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers,
				IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the
				Owner. The updated list of these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.
			</p>

			<h5>Legal basis of processing</h5>
			<p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some
					legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to
					such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the
					following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal
					Data is subject to European data protection law;
				</li>
				<li>
					provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or
					for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
				</li>
				<li>
					processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is
					subject;
				</li>
				<li>
					processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the
					exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;
				</li>
				<li>
					processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner
					or by a third party.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to
				the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or
				contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
			</p>

			<h5>Place</h5>
			<p>
				The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the
				parties involved in the processing are located.
			</p>
			<p>
				Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to
				a country other than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such
				transferred Data, Users can check the section containing details about the processing of
				Personal Data.
			</p>
			<p>
				Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country
				outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public
				international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security
				measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.
			</p>
			<p>
				If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections
				of this document or inquire with the Owner using the information provided in the contact
				section.
			</p>

			<h5>Retention time</h5>
			<p>
				Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have
				been collected for.
			</p>
			<p>Therefore:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the
					Owner and the User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.
				</li>
				<li>
					Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be
					retained as long as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information
					regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of
					this document or by contacting the Owner.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has
				given consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the
				Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so
				for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to
				access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability
				cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.
